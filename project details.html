   <b> Description  </b> : The human body is made of living cells which grow, divide into new cells, and die.
    Cell division is a continuous process in the human body and is a replacement of dying cells. However, 
    growing of abnormal cells and uncontrollable cell division are the causes of cancer. Skin cancer is one
     of the most common cancers in human beings, and it arises from the skin due to the abnormal growth of the 
     cells that can easily invade and spread to the other parts of the human body. There are two main categories 
     of skin cancers: (1) Melanoma skin cancers (MSC), (2) Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). The Benign and Malignant
      tumours are the main categories of Melanoma skin cancers (MSC) and Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), Squamous-cell 
      carcinoma (SCC) are the major types of Non- Melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). <br><br>
